software engineering is an engineering descipline that is concerned with all aspects of software development from its initial phase all the way through development,deployment, maintenance and documentation. It is important because it helps in the formulatation of high quality softwares with budget and time scope.
the raising of agile methodologies as opposed to the traditional waterfall model which didnt accomodate changing requirments. The raising of high level programing languages as opposed to machine code which was time consuming and prone to error. Lastly the raising of structured programming for better organisation and management of projects.
Requirement Gathering and Analysis;Collect and document stakeholder needs to understand what the software should achieve.System Design; Create detailed design specifications and architecture based on the requirements.             Implementation (Coding); Develop the software by writing code according to the design specifications.             Testing; Verify and validate that the software meets requirements and is free of defects.                      Deployment; Install and configure the software in a production environment for user access.                    Maintenance and Support; Monitor, update, and fix issues with the software post-deployment.
]The water fall model follows a Linear Process where each phase follows the previous one. It requires detailed documentation at every step and itâ€™s hard to make changes once started. Best for projects with stable, well-defined requirements, like government contracts. Agile Methodology follows an Iterative process where development occurs in short cycles called sprints. It involves continuous client feedback and easily adapts to changes. Ideal for dynamic projects where requirements evolve, like startup app development.
Software Developer writes, tests, and maintains code. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer develops and executes test to identify software defects and ensures the software meets quality and performance benchmarks. Project Manager defines project scope, timeline, and resources.
IDEs enhance coding efficiency, productivity, and error reduction by integrating tools like code completion, debugging, and built-in compilers into one platform for example video studio code. VCS enables collaboration, tracks changes, supports branching, and ensures reliable backups of the codebase for example Gathering
Complex Problem-Solving which can be overcome by breaking down problems into smaller tasks using algorithms and data structures effectively also Communication Gaps which can be overcome by improving communication skills and regularly meetings with team members, and clarify requirements.
Unit testing tests individual components or functions. It ensures each unit works correctly in isolation, catching issues early. Integration Testing testinteractions between integrated components or systems. It Identifies issues in data flow and interactions between units. System Testing tests the comple, integrated system as a whole. It verifies that the system meets specified requirements and works as intended. acceptance testing tests the system against user requirements and business needs it ensures the software fulfills user expectations and is ready for deployment
The practice of designing and refining input prompts to elicit the desired response from AI models. It helps in obtaining more relevant and accurate answers frm AI.
Vague Prompt is tell me about the project. It could be better by saying explain the main objectives and deliverables of the project charter. This prompt is better because it clerly specifies which project is being discussed and focuses on the main objectives and deliverables, guiding the response.
